    "His plot is the same as mine, but as i chose to make the plot for all the 6 continents it comes out that growth in GDP of africa and Australia are similar which his plot failed to capture and we both came to the same conclusion that africa has the lowest growth from them all.\n",

He got the conclusion that mainly for all the continents the GDP and life expectancy increased while with the decrease of child mortality rate overtime. \n",

He also concluded that mainly around 1925, Asia had the lowest life expectancy, after that Africa has the lowest life expectancy. Europe has the highest life expectancy according to him which goes in line with my findings too.\n",

    "For child mortality he also chose a line plot and his plot is way to similar to mine and he has the same conclusions as me which are the the rate has decreased from 1800 to present tremendously, Europe has the lowest rate throughout time and Asia had the highest child mortality in the early 1800â€™s, closely followed by Africa but run current times Africa has taken over Asia in terms of child mortality rate. So majority of our conclusions are the same."
