We are continuing with the same project for Phase 2.

# Problem 2

For this problem i choose to critique the visulation done in this repository : https://github.com/mrinaaall/DS-5500/blob/master/InfoVizHW1.pdf

In his plot he chose to visuailize the plot Average Continents GDP for every year using a line plot. He decided to do this only for the top 4 continents rather than all the 6 continents. 
His visualization is very easy to interpret and it can be clearly seen as he mentioned in the explanation that europe has the highest GDP whereas africa has the lowest. He also states that there is a sudden jump in GDP of asia somewhere in between 2000's.
His plot is the same as mine, but as i chose to make the plot for all the 6 continents it comes out that growth in GDP of africa and Australia are similar which his plot failed to capture and we both came to the same conclusion that africa has the lowest growth from them all.
But he did cover the fact that America had a sudden dip around 2010-2015 which did not show up in my findings

# Problem 3

For this problem I choose to critique the following repository: https://github.com/bishishta/Information-Visualization/tree/master/DS5500_HW1
        
He has made several different plots in order to visualise the said problem. He made a plot of all 3 with time just to see the general trend of the said parameters. He made  a different plot for each of the continents separately. He got the conclusion that mainly for all the continents the GDP and life expectancy increased while with the decrease of child mortality rate overtime. 

He also chose to plot 4 continents instead of all the 6. We see for the life expectancy that they dip on mainly two points in time i.e. mainly around the time of 1920's and 1940's. He also concluded that mainly around 1925, Asia had the lowest life expectancy, after that Africa has the lowest life expectancy. Europe has the highest life expectancy according to him which goes in line with my findings too.

For child mortality he also chose a line plot and his plot is way to similar to mine and he has the same conclusions as me which are the the rate has decreased from 1800 to present tremendously, Europe has the lowest rate throughout time and Asia had the highest child mortality in the early 1800â€™s, closely followed by Africa but run current times Africa has taken over Asia in terms of child mortality rate. So majority of our conclusions are the same.

# Problem 4


```python
gdp = pd.read_csv("dataset/ddf--datapoints--income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted--by--geo--time.csv")
life = pd.read_csv("dataset/ddf--datapoints--life_expectancy_years--by--geo--time.csv")
```


```python
gdp = gdp.drop(columns=['geo'])
life = life.drop(columns=['geo'])
```


```python
g = gdp.groupby('time').mean().reset_index()
l = life.groupby('time').mean() .reset_index()
```


```python
new = pd.merge(left = g,right = l)
new.columns
```




    Index(['time', 'income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted',
           'life_expectancy_years'],

### Before Training Scatter Plot


```python
plt.scatter(new['income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted'], new['life_expectancy_years'])
plt.title("Scatter Plot between Mean of GDP and Life Expectancy per year")
```

### Plot for the Whole Data


```python
plt.scatter(new.drop(columns=['life_expectancy_years', 'time']), new['life_expectancy_years'])
plt.plot(new.drop(columns=['life_expectancy_years', 'time']), lr.predict(new.drop(columns=['life_expectancy_years', 'time'])), color="green")
plt.title("Scatter Plot between Mean of GDP and Life Expectancy per year for Whole Data")
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Scatter Plot between Mean of GDP and Life Expectancy per year for Whole Data')




![png](/images/output_28_1.png)


We see that with the increase in GDP the Life expectancy also increases. So our linear model works well but the fit could have been made better with some different transformations. Here i took the mean of the value for the whole year to get the desired model. The model takes GDP as input and predicts Life expectancy. There may be correlation with the Time for both the variables because with time also both the values increase and that might be affecting the values but we cant say that for sure without doing more analysis.

We see that with the increase in GDP the Child Mortality decreases. So our linear model works well but the fit could have been made better with some different transformations. Here i took the mean of the value for the each year to get the desired model. The model takes GDP as input and predicts Life expectancy. There may be correlation with the Time for both the variables because with time, one values decreases as the other values increase. So time might be the factor controlling both the variables but we cant say for sure until we do further analysis.
